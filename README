# Yet Another Scheme Tutorial

This is a e-book from http://www.shido.info/lisp/idx_scm_e.html, the project of yast-cn is trying to translate it into Chinese.



# How to contribute

Just clone this repo and make a pull-requst after you translate some chap of it.




# How to translate

The orignal files are in `en` directory and the translated files are in `zh_cn` directory, so you just need to open two `docx` file in your computer, one of them is the orignal file and the other is a blank file. Just translate it into Chinese! DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FORMAT, WE WILL DO THAT LATER!

If you do have some difficult in translating some words or sentences, just leave it as it was and mark it, we may have a disscus later.



# The management of this project

Unluckly, we've used a stupid way to handle this project, if you have a better idea to namage such a project just tell me.
